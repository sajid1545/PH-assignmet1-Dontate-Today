                <h3>Situation Report</h3>
                <p class="para-1">Millions of people in the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have been affected by
                    torrential rains and flash floods in recent weeks, leaving them homeless and without valuables. The
                    country is on high alert, with homes destroyed, things floating away, and people missing. A fifth of
                    the country is presently under water.
                </p>
                <p class="para-2">The abrupt flash flood and water shortage have affected over 4.3 million people.
                    Meanwhile, millions of people have been stranded, more than 9 million are homeless, and displaced
                    women and girls are particularly vulnerable as they seek shelter in the open or in unfamiliar
                    places.

                <h3>Health & Environmental Impacts</h3>
                <p class="para-1">As of 20 June, thousands of cases of sickness and injuries had been reported,
                    including Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD), which accounts for 75 percent of cases, skin, respiratory,
                    and eye infections, and drowning. One of the most significant concerns is the potential for new
                    disease outbreaks when the water recedes.
                </p>
                <p class="para-2">Furthermore, 75,000 hectares of paddy and 300,000 hectares of other crops, including
                    maize and vegetables that are vital to the population's nourishment, have been devastated. As water
                    expands into new locations, more areas are at risk of destruction.
